# Photo Tagging Game

## Summary

Another project as part of [The Odin Project curriculum](https://stevenwalker91.github.io/photo-tagging-game/). The objective was to make a _Where's Waldo_ style game where users can search through an image and click to identify characters. 

The scope suggested a timer system, but I settled on a points-based scoring system instead, deducting points for wrong clicks and giving additional points dependent on the difficulty to find a given character.

This was my first project using Backend as a Service (BaaS) where I implemented a basic _Firestore_ database using _Firebase_.  

This project properly let me flex some of my React learnings so far and I tried to set it up in a fairly scalable way, where new maps can be added without too much effort. I'd love to build on this in future to add full backend capability where admin users can add their own images and define the 'clickable' characters.

A massive thanks to Egor Klyuchnyk who let me use his amazing art work for the project. He was very encouraging and has even expressed an interest in using the game for his personal site. You can see more of the fantastic work he's doing over on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/chekavo/?hl=en).
